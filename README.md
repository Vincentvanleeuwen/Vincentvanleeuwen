### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<div class="intro">
  
  <div>
    I'm a JavaScript Developer that creates websites, webapps and apps for the web!
    I'm currently doing my Bachelors Communication & Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Here I'm taught to look at 
    the web from the angle of a UX Designer. I strive for accessibility for everyone.

    Look through my projects to see what I've created, examples of languages/libraries used:
