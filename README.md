### Hi there 👋

I'm a JavaScript Developer that creates websites, webapps and apps for the web!
I'm currently doing my Bachelors Communication & Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Here I'm taught to look at the web from the angle of a UX Designer. I strive for accessibility for everyone.




Look through my projects to see what I've created, examples of libraries used:
- Vue.js
- Nuxt
- Socket IO
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- and many more..!
